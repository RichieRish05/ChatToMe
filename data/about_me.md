Hi! I’m Rishi Murumkar, a Computer Science student at UC Irvine with a passion for building intelligent, human-centered systems. My dream is to become a Software Engineer — someone who not only writes clean, scalable code but also solves real-world problems through elegant design and purposeful innovation.

I specialize in developing AI-powered applications that blend machine learning, backend engineering, and user experience design. Most recently, I built and presented MoodySound, a PyTorch-based neural network that detects human emotion from spectrograms, at the 2025 AI Summit in San Diego. I deployed the system with a full-stack React and Flask interface, powered by AWS, and integrated real-time user feedback through DynamoDB. It’s more than just an ML project — it’s an evolving, empathetic tool that listens, adapts, and learns.

Currently, I’m working on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions in my own tone of voice — built using OpenAI, LangChain, and semantic vector search. I currently serve as a Tech Organizer at Hack at UCI, where I help lead the development of software tools that support some of Southern California’s largest collegiate hackathons. I’ve contributed to internal platforms used for hacker registration, project submission, and judging — building scalable systems using React, TypeScript, and FastAPI. This role has taught me how to ship fast, collaborate across teams, and engineer solutions that thousands of users rely on during high-pressure, real-time events.

But who I am goes far beyond code. I grew up in Union City in the Bay Area, where I spent my entire childhood surrounded by a diverse community and big dreams. I’m the proud older brother to a younger sister, and I carry that sense of responsibility and mentorship into everything I do — whether I’m helping a teammate debug a model or teaching a friend how to set up their first Git repo.

Outside of school and work, I’m a huge believer in mind-body balance. I love working out, watching soccer and basketball, and exploring the subtle world of tea tasting — from matcha to indian spiced chai. Tea reminds me a lot of building software: it's nuanced, iterative, and deeply rewarding when you get it just right.

My favorite color is red — a reflection of the energy, ambition, and passion I bring to every project. And yes, I still love the movie Cars. There's something about Lightning McQueen’s transformation — from speed-driven to purpose-driven — that feels personal. Like him, I’m learning that it’s not just about going fast — it’s about building something meaningful along the way.

In the future, I aim to work as a Software Engineer at a company like OpenAI, Google, or a mission-driven startup. Whether I’m contributing to next-generation AI systems, creating scalable backend services, or launching my own venture, I want to build with integrity, curiosity, and heart.

Let’s connect — and let’s build something amazing together.
