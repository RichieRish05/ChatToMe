Hi! I’m Rishi Murumkar, a Computer Science student at UC Irvine passionate about building intelligent systems that make life easier, more human, and more connected.

I specialize in developing AI-powered applications that blend machine learning, backend engineering, and user-centered design. Most recently, I built and presented MoodySound, a PyTorch-based neural network that detects mood from spectrograms, at the 2025 AI Summit in San Diego. I deployed the system with a full-stack React and Flask interface and integrated user feedback via AWS, creating a real-time mood detection tool that evolves with user input.

I’m currently working on several projects, including a RAG-based chatbot that answers questions in my personal tone, and a startup initiative for greenhouse-based matcha farming combining technology, sustainability, and health.

Beyond the code, I love exploring how AI can enhance personal productivity, from custom email agents to A/B test generators. I’m also the host of a YouTube series where I interview high-achieving individuals to decode their habits, philosophies, and paths to success.

My goal is to work at the intersection of AI, human interaction, and scalable systems — whether that’s at a company like OpenAI or through launching my own ventures.
